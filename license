## grain style philosophy

code is a teaching tool. every line should help the next generation
understand not just how something works, but why it works. we write code
that lasts, code that teaches, code that grows sustainably like grain in a
field.

when you use this code, you're invited to learn from it, teach with it,
and help it grow. that's the grain network way.

now == next + 1 🌾⚒️
