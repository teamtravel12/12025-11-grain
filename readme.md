grain network prototype - november 12025

## what is 12025-11-grain?

12025-11-grain is a prototype repository for teamtravel12 exploring
grain network concepts during november 12025. this repository contains
documentation, experiments, and shared resources for the grain network.

what makes this special? this is a space for exploration and
prototyping. we're building tools, testing ideas, and documenting
patterns that will shape the grain network.

the grain_style.md document sets the tone for all zig development
across the network. it defines our constraints, our principles, and
our approach to writing code that teaches.

this is a prototype. experiments welcome. ideas flow. 🌾⚒️
