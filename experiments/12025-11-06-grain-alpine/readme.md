experimental alpine GUI environment with wayland and river

## the experiment

this is an experimental exploration of expanding our alpine GUI environment
on our Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Framework laptop QEMU environment (with sudo-user `xy`).
the goal is to set up a musl-based wayland compositor environment with river,
a zig-implemented dynamic-tiling window compositor.

## goals

- explore wayland on alpine linux with musl
- experiment with river compositor (zig-implemented)
- build a minimal, intentional GUI environment
- learn about wayland protocols and compositor architecture

## notes

this is experimental. things may break. things may change. this is about
exploration and learning, not production-ready setup.

## resources

- [river](https://github.com/riverwm/river) - zig-implemented wayland compositor
- [wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) - display server protocol
- [alpine linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) - security-oriented linux distribution
